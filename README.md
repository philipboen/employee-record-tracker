# Employee Record Tracker

The Employee Record Tracker is a simple console-based program written in C++ to manage employee records. It allows users to add employees, delete employees by ID, display the list of employees, and exit the program.

## Features

This program does the following:

- Add employees
- Delete employees by ID
- Display the list of employees
- Exit the program

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

C++ compiler. I did this using Visual Studio 2022.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Open with Visual Studio
3. Compile and run the program
4. Follow the instructions on the screen

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with the following options:

   - Add Employee
   - Delete Employee
   - Display Employees
   - Exit

2. Select an option by entering the corresponding number and pressing Enter.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to add or delete employees, display the list of employees, or exit the program.

## Conclusions

This program was a good exercise in using C++ to create a simple console-based program. I learned how to use classes and objects, loops, list for managing a collection of Employee objects, numeric_limits for handling input buffer clearing after reading integers and string for handling string input and storage in the Employee class.
